- **Poop**, Reason abandoned kittens die, full of poop. Mother cats have to stimulate the anal sphincter and genitals in order for it to use the washroom. Get a soft cloth and soak it in warm water. Gently rub said areas to stimulate them to release pee/poop.

- **Diet!**, Don't just feed the thing regular milk, or even that shit "kitten milk" you can get from Walmart. The stuff you're looking for is called Feline Mammalac, it contains all the nutrients it will need, plus it's powdered so it keeps better. Also, don't use a rubber nipples bottle, they will go ravenous on it and more than likely end up eating some of the chewed up rubber.

- **Warmth!**, We kept our abandoned kittens in a knitting basket, with a warm water bottle wrapped in a soft blanket. Make sure to wrap it well, as to not let it burn the kitten. Kittens are used to snuggling up to their mom/litter, and by itself in just a blanket, it won't last.
