## 1. THE `import` SEARCH PATH

Not all modules are stored as `.py` files. Some are built-in modules,
they are actually baked right into Python itself. Built-in modules behave just like regular modules, but their Python source code is not available, because they are not written in Python! (Like Python itself, these built-in modules are written in C.)

## 2. EXCEPTIONS

- Some programming languages encourage the use of error return codes, which you check.
  - Golang
  - Nodejs
- Python encourages the use of exceptions, which you handle.
